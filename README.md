# Stress_Detection
This is a directory for Stress detection using simple statistical methods, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models

The purpose of this repository is to find, test and create new processes for stress detection. In this repository we will test the performance of simple statistical models, machine learning and deep learning models in order to find the best solution for the problem of stress detection. from Additionally we will link below some of the datasets that we are going to test the models on.

## Datasets

1. [A Wearable Exam Stress Dataset for Predicting Cognitive Performance in Real-World Settings](https://physionet.org/content/wearable-exam-stress/1.0.0/): In this dataset we use the heart rate data in order to calculate heart rate variability that is going to be used for the models.

2. [Nurse Stress Prediction Wearable Sensors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyankraval/nurse-stress-prediction-wearable-sensors): Similarly in this dataset we use the heart rate data in order to calculate heart rate variability that is going to be used for the models.

3. [SWELL dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qiriro/swell-heart-rate-variability-hrv): This dataset comprises of heart rate variability (HRV) indices computed from the multimodal SWELL knowledge work (SWELL-KW) dataset for research on stress and user modeling, see [SWELL-KW](http://cs.ru.nl/~skoldijk/SWELL-KW/Dataset.html).

4. [Stress-Predict-Dataset](https://github.com/italha-d/Stress-Predict-Dataset): This dataset is associated with "Stress Monitoring Using Wearable Sensors: A Pilot Study and Stress-Predict Dataset" paper.

5. [Heart Rate Prediction to Monitor Stress Level](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/heart-rate-prediction-to-monitor-stress-level): The data comprises various attributes taken from signals measured using ECG recorded for different individuals having different heart rates at the time the measurement was taken. These various features contribute to the heart rate at the given instant of time for the individual.

## Libraries

We also used a set of custom libraries created by other authors in order to have a better understanding of the data and create a better Explanatory Data Analysis. Some of those libraries are: 

1. [pyhrv](https://github.com/PGomes92/pyhrv)
2. [hrv-analysis](https://github.com/Aura-healthcare/hrv-analysis)
3. [wearable-hrv](https://github.com/AminSinichi/wearable-hrv)
4. [Stress-Prediction-Using-HRV](https://github.com/realmichaelye/Stress-Prediction-Using-HRV)
5. [Stress Prediction using Wearable Device Data](https://github.com/kjspring/stress-detection-wearable-devices)
