# Stress_Detection
This is a directory for Stress detection using simple statistical methods, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models

The purpose of this repository is to find, test and create new processes for stress detection. In this repository we will test the performance of simple statistical models, machine learning and deep learning models in order to find the best solution for the problem of stress detection. from Additionally we will link below some of the datasets that we are going to test the models on.
